Client:
 - Created a simple login form without too much stylization.
 - Then created a class to connect to the Q Symfony Skeleton API.
 - If the correct user and pass are entered, the token will be stored into the cookies.

Wordpress:
 - Create custom post type for movies and post meta field.
 - Then create plugin movies review. Didn't want to delete custom post type,
  because I created that task first and it has movie list and single.
